TASK 1
An processArray function determines if a given array of numbers is even or odd. It iterates through each element and utilizes a conditional check to determine if it's even or odd. The number is squared if it's even and tripled if it's odd. After that, the function returns the result and makes a new array to hold the changed elements.

TASK 2
The main function takes an array of numbers and an array of strings as arguments.: strCharacters and processedNumbers. It iterates through both using array indexing and checks the corresponding number in the processedNumbers array for each string in the strCharacters. If the number is even, it capitalizes the string, while if odd, it lowercases it.
 
TASK 3
The createUserProfiles function creates user profiles with original and modified names, along with auto-incrementing IDs, stored in a new array for unique user identification within the system.
